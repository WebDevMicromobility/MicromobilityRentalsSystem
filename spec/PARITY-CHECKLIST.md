# PARITY-CHECKLIST.md — MicroMobility Rentals

A flat checklist of every discrete behaviour the new version must reproduce, phrased as
testable statements.

**Sources**: the 87-file Playwright suite (`tests/*.spec.ts`, **~400 unique tests, run across
2 projects = 802 assertions per full run**), plus behaviour read directly from the code that no
test currently pins.

**How to read it**: items marked **[T]** are already encoded as an automated test in the current
system — the test name is given, so the new implementation can port it. Items marked **[R]** were
derived by reading the code and are *not* currently covered by a test. Items marked **[⚠]** are
known defects or inconsistencies in the current system: reproducing them is a deliberate choice.

---

## 1. Identity and authentication

- [ ] **[T]** A dropped request during password reset or login is retried once before giving up — `release-and-stock.spec.ts` *(added 2026-08-26)*.
- [ ] **[T]** A genuine refusal (bad password, locked account) is **not** retried — it is the answer.
- [ ] **[T]** Signup is deliberately **not** retried, so a landed insert is never repeated as a duplicate.

- [ ] **[R]** A customer signs up with first name, last name, email, phone, password, height, gender.
- [ ] **[R]** A password must be at least 8 characters with at least one uppercase letter and one digit.
- [ ] **[R]** Signing up with an email or phone that already exists is refused with a duplicate error.
- [ ] **[R]** A customer can sign in with **either** their email or their phone number.
- [ ] **[T]** A phone number is normalised to one canonical form before use — `norm-phone.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Arabic-Indic digits, `00966`, `+966`, `0…` and bare forms all normalise to the same phone.
- [ ] **[R]** After 8 consecutive failed logins the identifier is locked for 15 minutes.
- [ ] **[R]** A successful login clears the failure counter.
- [ ] **[R]** A successful login **reuses** the existing session token, so other signed-in devices stay valid.
- [ ] **[R]** A legacy `sha256:` password hash is transparently upgraded to bcrypt on next login.
- [ ] **[R]** Password reset requires **both** the email and the phone to match, and refuses OAuth-only accounts.
- [ ] **[T]** The auth page renders and behaves correctly, including forgot-password — `auth-page.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A password reset sends a normalised phone (leading zero stripped) and logs the user in — `auth-page.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** "Remember me" defaults **ON**; off stores the session in `sessionStorage` instead.
- [ ] **[R]** If storage throws (blocked cookies), the session falls back to memory and **never** surfaces as a connection error.
- [ ] **[R]** A stored session with no `session_token` is discarded and the customer must sign in again.
- [ ] **[R]** Google sign-in inside an in-app browser shows a specific explanation rather than failing silently.
- [ ] **[T]** Staff can sign in by phone number, resolved to their account email — `staff-phone.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** First-time staff are forced to change their password before using the panel — `staff-pwd.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** An unlocked staff device is only re-locked on a positive "not staff" verdict — never on a network error.
- [ ] **[R]** An expired staff access token is refreshed rather than treated as a sign-out.
- [ ] **[T]** Front desk sees only the Sales and Bookings tabs — `frontdesk.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Staff role is UX scoping only — the database grants both roles identical rights.

## 2. Sessions and visibility

- [ ] **[R]** A session is visible to a signed-out visitor only when `required_tag_id` is null.
- [ ] **[R]** `list_sessions` returns ungated sessions plus those whose required tag the caller **actively** holds.
- [ ] **[R]** An invalid or absent token returns ungated sessions only, never an error.
- [ ] **[R]** Community sessions are created with `required_tag_id = null` — visible to all, bookable by members.
- [ ] **[R]** Only sessions with status `open` or `full` are offered for booking.
- [ ] **[R]** The session list shows only the sessions of the event chosen on the landing page.
- [ ] **[R]** Choosing "Micromobility Experiences" lists **every** non-JCC session, both community ride kinds.
- [ ] **[T]** Session promo settings persist correctly — `sessions-promo.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A session cannot be deleted while it has bookings; a deleted session is restorable.
- [ ] **[R]** A JCC session can repeat for 1–12 weeks.
- [ ] **[R]** Session times are stored as `"HH:MM - HH:MM"` inside `bike_slots._time`.
- [ ] **[R]** On an approval ride the same field means "gathering - start" and renders as two labelled times.

## 3. Membership gating

- [ ] **[T]** A non-member cannot book a community ride — `members-gate.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The members-only dialog appears with the WhatsApp and Instagram routes — `members-gate.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** The gate is applied at the event card, the session card, and again at submit.
- [ ] **[R]** The database trigger raises exactly `This ride is for community members only.`
- [ ] **[R]** Staff are exempt from the members gate.
- [ ] **[T]** A tag is active only within its start/expiry window — `temp-tags.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** `starts_at` is inclusive, `expires_at` is **exclusive**; null means unbounded.
- [ ] **[R]** Tag windows are milliseconds since epoch, and the client and server must agree.
- [ ] **[R]** Member counts show active holders only.
- [ ] **[R]** No customer-facing API ever reveals the tag system; `community_member` returns a bare boolean.
- [ ] **[R]** Every new account automatically receives all `auto_grant` tags.

## 4. Booking

- [ ] **[T]** A waiver step sits between the riders and the review, and cannot be walked past — `waiver.spec.ts` *(added 2026-08-26)*.
- [ ] **[T]** Going back from review lands on the waiver rather than skipping it — `waiver.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The agreement does not survive into the next booking — `waiver.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Every rider on a party booking carries the waiver version, not just the first — `waiver.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The client sends a version (which wording), never a timestamp — `waiver.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** `waiver_at` is stamped server-side from `now()`; a caller-chosen time is not evidence.
- [ ] **[R]** The copy names who is covered: "on behalf of every rider on this booking".
- [ ] **[⚠]** A walk-in booked at the desk carries no waiver — coverage is customer-side only.

- [ ] **[T]** A booking is created through the `customer_create_booking` RPC — `booking-rpc.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A booking carrying a promo code inserts correctly — `booking-promo-insert.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The three-step wizard renders and advances correctly — `reg-flow-ui.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** The wizard shows a 1-2-3 stepper with passed steps ticked.
- [ ] **[R]** Continue is disabled until a session is selected.
- [ ] **[R]** Quantity is 1–10 on JCC, 1–4 on the Petromin ride, and locked to 1 on the Saturday ride.
- [ ] **[R]** Rider 1's name defaults to the account holder.
- [ ] **[R]** Height maps to size: ≤166 XS, 167–172 S, 173–178 M, ≥179 L.
- [ ] **[R]** A customer with an existing live booking on that session sees an "already booked" banner offering **Modify existing**, and is not double-booked.
- [ ] **[R]** The duplicate check re-fetches the queue first, so a second tab cannot slip through.
- [ ] **[R]** The duplicate match is by account id, falling back to phone for accountless bookings.
- [ ] **[R]** The server's returned `queue_num`, `status`, `waitlist_num` and `price` **override** the client's guesses.
- [ ] **[T]** A queue-number collision is retried with fresh numbers — `renumber.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A collision rolls back partially inserted rows before retrying, up to 4 attempts.
- [ ] **[R]** The first rider's height is saved to the profile if it was missing.
- [ ] **[T]** A group booking creates one row per rider sharing a group id — `group-id-grouping.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A JCC group booking works from the desk — `jcc-group.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A group booking counts as one visit per customer, not one per rider — `analytics-growth.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Cancelling a group cancels every rider in it — `cancel-group.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A whole group booking can be edited in one place — `group-edit.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** `customer_create_booking` rejects a batch that is empty, longer than 10, or spans two sessions.

## 5. Pricing and money

- [ ] **[T]** Money is calculated and displayed correctly throughout — `money.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Prices round correctly — `round10.spec.ts`, `round11-chaos.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Road 75, Hybrid 57.5, Mountain 57.5, Any 57.5, Road Carbon 250, Own 0 — and `ride_prices` must match the client.
- [ ] **[R]** `Any` displays as a range (SAR 57.5 – 75).
- [ ] **[R]** A client-sent price is **ignored** — the trigger writes the canonical price.
- [ ] **[R]** A promo can only reduce a price, never increase it.
- [ ] **[R]** A free community ride is priced 0 unconditionally.
- [ ] **[R]** Price is always clamped to 0…1000.
- [ ] **[R]** Once a bike is assigned or the row is paid, the price trigger stops interfering.
- [ ] **[R]** `Road Carbon` is never repriced from the assigned bike (250 must not become 75).
- [ ] **[T]** Staff can override a booking's price — `edit-price.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A type-restricted "on the house" default applies only to the listed bike types — `walkin-group.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The house/team payment markers behave correctly — `house-team.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** The house perk applies only to the first entry and only when the name matches the account holder.
- [ ] **[T]** A POS discount is recorded as a negative `__discount__` line — `pos-discount.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A card/cash split writes a qty-0 `__cardmeta__` line.
- [ ] **[T]** A refund restocks the item — `refund-restock.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Aggregations exclude `__cardmeta__` and qty-0 lines and reverse `refunded` ones.
- [ ] **[T]** Close-out totals are correct, including the card/cash split — `closeout.spec.ts`, `report-totals.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Analytics offers a VAT inclusive/exclusive toggle; exclusive is value ÷ 1.15.

## 6. Promo codes

- [ ] **[T]** Promo usage limits are enforced — `promo-limits.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Promo state stays in sync across devices — `promo-sync.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A code matches case-insensitively.
- [ ] **[R]** A code is invalid when inactive, expired (Asia/Riyadh date), used up, or bound to another customer.
- [ ] **[R]** The customer is told **which** condition failed.
- [ ] **[R]** `uses` increments on booking, decrements on cancel/remove, and re-increments on restore.
- [ ] **[R]** Promo entry is offered on JCC bookings only.

## 7. Capacity, places and the waitlist

- [ ] **[T]** A place is held from booking right through the ride — `capacity-holds.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Checking a rider in does **not** free a place — `capacity-holds.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Finishing a ride does **not** free a place — `capacity-holds.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A cancellation frees a place — `capacity-holds.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A no-show frees a place — `capacity-holds.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** An own-bike rider never consumes a place — `own-bike-spots.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Any number of own-bike riders can be seated on top of a full allocation.
- [ ] **[R]** The client and the database count places identically (`cancelled`/`removed`/`noshow` excluded, `Own` excluded).
- [ ] **[R]** Approval rides use `spots`; every other session uses `capacity`; the default is 12.
- [ ] **[R]** The capacity guard exempts approval rides entirely.
- [ ] **[R]** Two simultaneous bookings for the last place cannot both succeed (advisory lock).
- [ ] **[T]** The "expected" count is correct and excludes stale rows from past sessions — `expected-count.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Waitlisted bookings are visible where they should be — `waitlist-visible.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** An auto-waitlisted booking appears on the Waitlist page — `waitlist-shows-bookings.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A booking staff also parked by hand is listed once, not twice — `waitlist-shows-bookings.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Folded-in waitlist rows carry the booking's controls, not the desk-row ones — `waitlist-shows-bookings.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Reordering real waitlist rows never writes to a folded-in one — `waitlist-shows-bookings.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Waitlist rows sort by W number, the order promotion takes them in — `waitlist-shows-bookings.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A walk-up and a hand-picked rider share one list — `desk-waitlist.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A device pointing at the removed waitlist view lands on the list, not a blank tab — `desk-waitlist.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A waitlisted booking's W position is editable, because promotion follows it — `desk-waitlist.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Handing a walk-up a bike books a real queue entry and clears them off the list — `desk-waitlist.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A waitlist size cap can be set as a flat count or a percentage of capacity (minimum 1); absent or 0 means unlimited.
- [ ] **[R]** Joining is refused when the waitlist cap is reached.
- [ ] **[R]** Auto-promotion picks W1 by `waitlist_num` then registration time.
- [ ] **[R]** Auto-promotion is a conditional write, so a stale device cannot promote the same row twice.
- [ ] **[R]** Auto-promotion consumes the promoted booking's add-on stock.
- [ ] **[R]** Auto-promotion sends a push notification.
- [ ] **[R]** Approval rides **never** auto-promote.
- [ ] **[T]** A place freed by a **removal** promotes the next waitlisted rider — `release-and-stock.spec.ts` *(fixed 2026-08-26)*.
- [ ] **[⚠]** A place freed by the **customer's own cancellation** still promotes nobody — blocked by RLS, needs a server-side fix (BUSINESS-RULES.md §4.7).

## 8. Queue numbers

- [ ] **[T]** Queue numbers are assigned by the server and never reused — `renumber.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** The client's `queue_num` is always overwritten on insert.
- [ ] **[R]** `(session_id, queue_num)` is unique except for cancelled, removed and no-show rows.
- [ ] **[R]** Numbers never shift down — gaps are correct and expected.
- [ ] **[R]** An undone booking gets its old number back if still free, else a fresh one.
- [ ] **[R]** A queue-number update that would collide takes a fresh number instead of failing.
- [ ] **[T]** A community booking never exposes a queue number — `comm-no-number.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A community QR payload is `MMC-<id6>`; a circuit one is `MMC-<num>-<id6>`.
- [ ] **[T]** Staff can edit a queue number where allowed — covered via `staff.spec.ts`.

## 9. Check-in, bikes and the ride

- [ ] **[T]** Two devices cannot check the same rider in twice — `checkin-race.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The quick check-in modal works from the queue and the waitlist — `checkin-quick.spec.ts`, `quick-checkin.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A reserved bike is claimed atomically on check-in — `reserve-bike.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A bike claim is a compare-and-swap on `status='available'`; a lost race releases what was claimed and warns.
- [ ] **[R]** Retired and maintenance bikes never appear in the picker.
- [ ] **[R]** A `Road Carbon` booking is matched against **Road** bikes.
- [ ] **[R]** Bike size is a sort preference, not a hard filter.
- [ ] **[R]** Check-in accepts both `waiting` and `waitlist` rows.
- [ ] **[R]** Checking in a waitlisted rider is where their add-on stock is finally reserved.
- [ ] **[R]** A payment chosen in the quick modal is carried over into the bike picker, not discarded.
- [ ] **[R]** `checked_in_at` / `checked_out_at` / `ride_duration` are recorded.
- [ ] **[T]** A bulk check-in stamps `checked_in_at` only on rows whose status write landed — `release-and-stock.spec.ts` *(fixed 2026-08-26)*.
- [ ] **[T]** Bike editing works, including colours and identifiers — `bike-edit.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Bikes move `available → in-use` on check-in and back on return, cancel, no-show or removal.
- [ ] **[R]** Orphan bikes (in-use with no live booking) are reset to available at boot.
- [ ] **[R]** One booking row can hold several bikes via a JSON array in `assigned_bike_id`.

## 10. Add-on stock

- [ ] **[T]** A confirmed booking holds its add-on stock — `addon-stock-invariant.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Checking a waitlisted rider in reserves it — `addon-stock-invariant.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A rider who never left the waitlist releases nothing when cancelled — `addon-stock-invariant.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A confirmed rider marked no-show gives the unit back — `addon-stock-invariant.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A rider cancelled after checking in gives back exactly one — `addon-stock-invariant.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** No-show handling and add-ons stay consistent — `noshow-addons.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Stock may go negative (oversell/backorder) on the staff path — clamping would mint phantom stock on refund.
- [ ] **[T]** Staff stock writes are a delta under a compare-and-swap, so two tills cannot overwrite each other — `release-and-stock.spec.ts` *(fixed 2026-08-26)*.
- [ ] **[⚠]** The customer stock RPC still clamps at zero, contradicting the deliberate-negative rule — one-line migration, not applied.

## 11. Approval workflow

- [ ] **[T]** Unique approved riders are counted once however many times they were approved — `analytics-approved.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Pending, rejected and cancelled riders are not approved riders — `analytics-approved.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A walk-in with no account still counts as one person — `analytics-approved.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** JCC bookings never reach the approval card — `analytics-approved.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A NULL `approval` on a community booking reads as **pending**.
- [ ] **[R]** A customer can never set or change `approval` — the whitelist excludes it and the guard reverts it.
- [ ] **[R]** Approving keeps the original queue number.
- [ ] **[R]** While `hide_queue` is set, riders see only "under review".

## 11b. The Thursday swim session (bike-free community)

- [ ] **[T]** A swim session is `event_kind='community'`, `ride_kind='swim'` and reports `_needsBike` false — `swim-session.spec.ts` *(added 2026-08-26)*.
- [ ] **[T]** It keeps the Saturday shape: members-only, staff-approved, solo, free, hidden queue.
- [ ] **[T]** Choosing it skips the riders step entirely — no height, no size, no bike type.
- [ ] **[T]** Back from the waiver returns to the session list, not to an empty step.
- [ ] **[T]** The booking carries `type_preference='None'` (a sentinel, not `'Any'`) and an empty size.
- [ ] **[T]** The swimmer agrees to a **swim** waiver — title, body and the "on behalf of everyone" line all name the activity — stamped `swim-2026-08-v1`.
- [ ] **[T]** Staff checking a swimmer in are offered no bike picker.
- [ ] **[T]** It carries its own identity colour (`ev-swim` teal), not the circuit blue.
- [ ] **[R]** Thursday is just the session's date; no code enforces a weekday.
- [ ] **[R]** Adding another bike-free activity costs one entry in `BIKELESS_KINDS`.

## 12. The Petromin (paid group community) ride

- [ ] **[T]** The paid community ride behaves as specified — `petromin-ride.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** It is a community ride (members gate applies) that **charges JCC prices**.
- [ ] **[R]** It has **no approval step**: real queue numbers, seats overflowing to the waitlist, auto-promotion.
- [ ] **[R]** It is capped at **4 riders per account per session**, enforced client-side and by trigger.
- [ ] **[R]** Booking twice cannot get around the 4-rider cap.
- [ ] **[R]** It offers the **Own bike** option, free, and hides **Road Carbon**.
- [ ] **[R]** It uses bike composition, not a seat count; `spots` is explicitly null.
- [ ] **[R]** It has no meeting-point or breakfast fields.
- [ ] **[R]** Its session times are plain start–end, not gathering/start.
- [ ] **[R]** It is themed red; the Saturday ride green; JCC blue.

## 13. Cancellation, no-show, removal

- [ ] **[R]** A customer may set only `cancelled`, `waiting` or `waitlist` on their own booking.
- [ ] **[R]** A customer cancel cancels the whole party.
- [ ] **[R]** There is **no** time-based cancellation window and no fee.
- [ ] **[R]** Staff cancel of a `waiting`/`active` row requires a confirm; a `waitlist` row cancels immediately; anything else refuses.
- [ ] **[R]** A no-show frees its place but keeps its queue number reserved.
- [ ] **[R]** "Customer showed" reverses a no-show and re-reserves add-on stock.
- [ ] **[R]** A cancelled booking is restorable, with an over-capacity confirm (skipped for own-bike community rows).
- [ ] **[R]** A removed booking is restored to `done` if there is ride evidence, else `waiting`.
- [ ] **[T]** Every destructive staff action offers an Undo — `log-undo.spec.ts`, `undo-double.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** An Undo cannot be applied twice — `undo-double.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A rescheduled booking respects the gate rules — `reschedule-gate.spec.ts`.

## 14. Account deletion

- [ ] **[T]** Deleting an account unlinks the bookings first so the foreign key holds — `delete-account.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Deletion is refused while the rider has a live booking, writing nothing — `delete-account.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Tags, notes and push subscriptions go with the account — `delete-account.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The booking rows themselves are never deleted — `delete-account.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** An undo restores the account and re-links the bookings — `delete-account.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Front desk never sees the delete button — `delete-account.spec.ts`.

## 15. Search and rosters

- [ ] **[T]** A booking number finds a rider from its first digit — `search-groups.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Finding one rider by number brings their whole party — `search-groups.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A party tied by the account, not a group id, widens too — `search-groups.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A name match widens to the party as well — `search-groups.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A solo rider stays solo — `search-groups.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A raw booking id still matches when it happens to be all digits — `search-groups.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The waitlist picker offers a party as one line, found by number — `search-groups.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A `W` prefix aims at the waitlist position instead of the booking number.
- [ ] **[R]** Party widening happens inside the already-filtered set, so status/pay/size filters still mean what they say.
- [ ] **[T]** A chosen session lists every rider, past 159 and past 189 — `queue-full-roster.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Cancelled bookings stay out of the roster — `queue-full-roster.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** No "Show more" is left dangling once a session lists in full — `queue-full-roster.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The all-sessions view keeps its cap and names how many are held back — `queue-full-roster.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Status filter labels are correct per ride type — `status-filter-labels.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The staff list supports session filtering and multi-rider parties — `staff-list.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A walk-up row belongs to no session and never hides behind the session filter — `staff-list.spec.ts`.

## 16. Offline and resilience

- [ ] **[T]** The app boots when the network is unavailable — `boot-resilience.spec.ts`, `offline.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Bookings made offline flush on reconnect — `outbox-flush.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** The outbox flushes through the RPC, not a raw insert — `outbox-rpc.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A duplicate-key error on flush is treated as already-landed, not as a failure.
- [ ] **[R]** Outbox rows carry stable client-generated ids so a replay cannot double-book.
- [ ] **[T]** Sales made offline are queued and flushed — `sales-back.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** A deleted sale can never resurrect, because an RLS-blocked DELETE returns no error.
- [ ] **[T]** Storage quota exhaustion is handled without breaking the app — `storage-quota.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** The cold-start snapshot strips photos and is never written from a PII-free load on a staff device.
- [ ] **[R]** Offline detection uses both `navigator.onLine` and an observed write failure.
- [ ] **[T]** Failed writes are surfaced, never silently swallowed — `write-failures.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** A date move that cannot create the new session leaves the old one alone — `write-failures.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Photos are cached separately and survive app updates — `cache-photos.spec.ts`.

## 17. Realtime and performance

- [ ] **[R]** Seven tables are subscribed on one channel, debounced 350 ms.
- [ ] **[R]** Nothing refreshes while the tab is hidden; `visibilitychange` catches up.
- [ ] **[R]** Reconnect uses capped exponential backoff and ignores callbacks from a removed channel.
- [ ] **[R]** A 30-second poll backs realtime up.
- [ ] **[T]** The queue renders performantly with many rows — `queue-perf.spec.ts`, `perf-smooth.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Reads that grow unbounded are paged (PostgREST caps at 1000 rows).
- [ ] **[R]** The queue loads a 60-day window at boot and widens to 365 days shortly after.
- [ ] **[R]** Customers are fetched only on staff devices.

## 18. Security and privacy

- [ ] **[T]** The security model holds — `secure.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** The anon key can never read `customers` or named bookings.
- [ ] **[R]** Public availability comes from the no-PII `queue_public` view only.
- [ ] **[R]** Staff views read the denormalised name/phone/email on each booking row.
- [ ] **[R]** Known rider details are preserved if a later refresh comes back PII-free.
- [ ] **[T]** CSV exports are hardened against formula injection — `csv-injection.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** Printed reports escape user content — `report-xss.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[T]** User content is escaped everywhere it is rendered — `esc-guard.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** Internal files (`.sql`, `.md`, source, tests, scripts, functions, dotfiles) are 404ed by middleware, matched on the fully decoded path.
- [ ] **[R]** The wallet, push and email endpoints all re-verify ownership through a token-checked RPC and never trust client-supplied data.
- [ ] **[R]** The push endpoint verifies the caller is staff before sending anything.

## 19. Internationalisation

- [ ] **[T]** Language packs load and apply correctly — `lang-packs.spec.ts`.
- [ ] **[R]** English is inline; Arabic is fetched as a versioned JSON pack.

- [ ] **[R]** `?lang=` selects the language and is kept in sync without adding history entries.
- [ ] **[R]** EN/AR key parity is a build-breaking gate (currently 1,734 keys). *(Spanish was dropped 2026-08-26.)*

- [ ] **[R]** A confirmation dialog always renders above the modal that raised it.
- [ ] **[R]** Every interactive element has a visible focus ring.
- [ ] **[R]** Touch targets are at least 44 px; inputs are 16 px so iOS does not zoom.
- [ ] **[R]** `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured.
- [ ] **[T]** SEO metadata and the static no-JS intro are present — `seo.spec.ts`.

## 22. Deliberate quirks worth preserving (or consciously fixing)

- [ ] **[⚠]** Queue-number gaps are permanent — `_shiftDownAfter` is an intentional no-op.
- [ ] **[⚠]** Inventory categories, brands, flavours and bike taxonomies live in **localStorage only** and do not sync between devices.
- [ ] **[⚠]** The `queue_entries` INSERT policy is still open to anon, pending the offline-client rollover.
- [ ] **[⚠]** `queue_entries.price` still has a stale column default of `30` while the app's default is `57.5`.
- [ ] **[⚠]** `customer_shiftdown` still renumbers server-side although the client's own shift is disabled.
- [ ] **[R]** A deploy takes effect on the **second** load, because navigations are stale-while-revalidate.
