# The instant lane: push the site live from this machine in under a minute.
#
# CI is the safety net — every push still runs the full suite and deploys on
# green (~5-6 min). THIS is for the moments that cannot wait for a runner to
# wake up: it builds (1-2s), refuses to ship what git does not have, uploads
# straight to Cloudflare Pages, and prints what it did.
#
# One-time setup, either:
#   npx wrangler login                          # browser sign-in on this machine
# or put the two values in .env.deploy (gitignored, chmod 600):
#   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=...                    # a Pages:Edit token
#   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
#
# Flags: --dirty  ship despite uncommitted changes (the guard exists because a
#                 live site running code that is in no commit is undebuggable).
#
# Two guards have no flag. Untracked files inside a folder that ships are refused: dist/ copies
# those folders whole, so a work-in-progress functions/api/x.js would go live as an endpoint.
# And HEAD must be exactly origin/main: CI deploys origin/main, so shipping from a checkout that
# is behind it rolls production back, and shipping unpushed commits puts code live that CI will
# overwrite on its next run. Push or pull first.
